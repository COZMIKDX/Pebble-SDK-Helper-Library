# Pebble-SDK-Helper-Library
A library to help make Pebble Watchface/App dev a little less annoying.

The pebble SDK requires you to do a bit a of setup for all sorts of elements like images, text, the layers they are placed onto, etc.
In a basic project following the example project on the pebble developer website, you are placing several function calls throughout the main project file.
For example, setting the layers for images in one place, composition and animated values in another, and deletion handlers set up elsewhere.

With this library I intend for creation of such elements to be more streamlined and their values easily accessible.
